# Quiet Hours Scheduler

A full-stack web application that allows authenticated users to schedule silent-study time blocks and receive automated email reminders 10 minutes before each block begins.

This project demonstrates a modern web development stack, including a Next.js frontend, a complete Supabase backend (database, authentication, storage, edge functions), and integration with a third-party email service (Resend).

## ðŸš€ Key Features


- **Secure User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in with email/password or social providers (Google).  
- **Time Block Management (CRUD)**: Logged-in users can create, view, and manage their own study blocks.  
- **Interactive Calendar Dashboard**: A visual calendar displays all scheduled blocks, with different views (Month, Week, Day, Agenda).  
- **Automated Email Reminders**: A background CRON job runs every minute, triggering a serverless function to check for upcoming sessions.  
- **Reliable Notification System**: Prevents duplicate notifications by marking reminders as "sent" in the database.  
- **Secure & Scalable Backend**: Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users only access their own data.
